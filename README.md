It is very important to monitor, analyze and finalize the temperature in the application of smart home systems. The temperature data is a guide for the user on how to proceed and how to save money. In this project, the monitoring of the temperature is given graphically. Since the project is in the draft state, the process has been shown by transferring computer data on only one hard disk. Intended; By expanding the scope of the project, the data is shown to the user via sms or a smart application (app). But in this case, only the data in the project was monitored in the computer environment. In the project, data was sent to the PIC18F46K22 microprocessor by working simultaneously with the DHT22 (Temperature and Humidity) Sensor and the Clock (DS3232) module. The received data is transferred to the SD-CARD with the RBO output pin. It is written to a file with the extension “.ima” within the SD-CARD module. Thanks to the WinImage program, the received data is converted to the “.text” extension. With the RS232 communication with the slave processor (PIC18F26K20), these data were seen on the GUI application in C#.
